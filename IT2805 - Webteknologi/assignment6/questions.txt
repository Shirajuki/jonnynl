1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?
- The following expression evaluates to false in javascript binary representation of floating point values, since
  the the numbers are being converted from decimal (base10) to binary (base2) since the computer computes in binary.
  Because of this we get rounding errors most of the time. Using the Number method .toPrecision(n) we can see that 0.1.toPrecision(17) is indeed not exactly 0.1 but
  0.10000000000000001. Since the precision is off by some decimals, we get false.

2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
- The method attribute on a form element decides how we send the form-data/which HTTP method to send the data with. It can be either sent as URL variables with method GET),
  or as HTTP post transaction with method POST.

3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is
changed to GET ?
- The form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is method GET as it's
  a type of HTTP request where we can specify the data requeste to the server using the URL. Thus the form fields would appear on the URL.

4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or
Javascript?
- It is considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML and/or Javascript as it is pretty vulnerable to sorts of code injections/scriptings since it is possible to alter the data being sent
  browser/client side. When we validate form inputs it is better/good practice to validate the data on the server.

5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input ?
- Textarea element is a multiline text field which allows line break in the typed text by the user.
  It is appropriate to use textarea over input when we need the user to input multilined texts.

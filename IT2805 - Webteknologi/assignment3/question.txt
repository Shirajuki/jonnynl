1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed ?
- The difference between position: absolute and position: fixed is that absolute
  is positioned relative to it's parentElement which moves along page scroll.
  position: fixed is instead positioned relative to it's viewport, meaning the
  browser window itself. This means that fixed will stay right there on page
  scroll.

2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
- To access the third element within another element one can use the
  pseudo-selector: nth-child. --> parentElement childElement:nth-child(3) { }.

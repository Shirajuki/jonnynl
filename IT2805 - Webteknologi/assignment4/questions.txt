1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
- Mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements in order to save and protect the userâ€™s mobile bandwidth meaning their mobile data.
  As most mobile data providers charge based on the amount of data is consumed. This was specifically done by the OS developers for the user's best interest.

2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a
device with 320 x 568 resolution?
- If the visitor is browsing on a device with 320 x 568 resolution, the CSS snippet won't kick in. As it's only checking for
  the width from 768 to 1024. The visitor's device's width is 320, not in the range of what the CSS is looking at. The element without
  id "logo" won't be set to "display: none".

3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of
dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
- Some advantages of having a single responsive website instead of a dedicated version is that the mobile-dedicated site first of all is in an another URL
  If not updated alongside the main website, they would exclude some of the new contents added.
  Working with a mobile-dedicated sites means working on more than one separate website, as to a single responsive website.
  This means more difficulties for the persons who has to work/add changes on both the websites.

```
@media only screen
and (min-device-width : 768px)
and (max-device-width : 1024px) {
  #logo {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

<h1 id="summary-8">SUMMARY 8</h1>
<p>In this chapter we considered how different forms of information are represented in the computer. You learned the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With RGBA color, each intensity is a 1-byte numeric quantity represented as a binary number.</li>
  <li>Binary representation and binary arithmetic are the same as they are for decimal numbers, but they are limited to two digits.</li>
  <li>The decimal equivalent of binary numbers is determined by adding their powers of 2 corresponding to 1‚Äôs.</li>
  <li>We can use arithmetic on the intensities to ‚Äúcompute on the representation,‚Äù for example, making gray lighter and coloriz a black-and-white picture from the nineteenth century.</li>
  <li>When digitizing sound, sampling rate and measurement precision determine how accurate the digital form is; uncompressed audio requires more than 80 million bits per minute.</li>
  <li>Compression makes large files manageable: MP3 for audio, JPEG for still pictures, and MPEG for video. These compact representations work because they remove unnecessary information.</li>
  <li>Optical character recognition technology improves our world.</li>
  <li>The Bias-Free Universal Medium Principle embodies the magic of computers through universal bit representations and unbiased encoding.</li>
</ul>

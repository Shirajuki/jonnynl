<h1 id="summary-9">Summary 9</h1>
<p>This chapter began by describing Taylor’s code for an app’s splash page. You learned the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modern software is written in a language using familiar terms and operations, though they are expressed very briefly; the code relies heavily on the software stack.</li>
  <li>The repeating process of the Fetch/Execute Cycle fetches each instruction (indicated by the PC), decodes the operation, retrieves the data, performs the operation, and stores the result back into the memory.</li>
  <li>This process is hardwired into the control subsystem, one of the five components of a processor.</li>
  <li>The memory, a very long sequence of bytes, each with an address, stores the program and data while the program is running.</li>
  <li>The ALU does the actual computing.</li>
  <li>The input and output units are the interfaces for the peripheral devices connected to the computer.</li>
  <li>Machine instructions do not refer to the data (operands) directly, but rather indirectly. Thus, different computations can be done with an instruction, jsut by changing the data in the referenced memory locations each time the instructions is executed.</li>
  <li>Programmers use sophisticated programming languages to create complex applications software as well as operating systems.</li>
  <li>The basic ideas of integrated circuits are integrating active and connective components, fabrication by photolithography, and controlling conductivity through the field of effect.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Finding the Right Address.</strong> If the address of the byte in the following sequence is 1020, what is the address of the last byte? <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">42 72 65 61 6B 27 73 20 6F 76 65 72 2E</code> <br />
Knowing that these are hexadecimal values, check Figure 7.3 to see what this memory is remembering.
    <ul>
      <li>The address of 2E is 1032, or if 1020 to base16 = 102C. Spells out “Break’s over.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Another Device.</strong> Figure 9.4 shows several devices attached to the I/O subsystems that are typical of a phone or laptop. If a CD/DVD drive were shown, how would it attach to the I/O units?
    <ul>
      <li>The CD/DVD would attach on both input and output as it can both read/write.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Same Data, Different Operations.</strong> Using the data from Figure 9.7, execute the multiply instruction MUL 4000, 2000, 2080 and (read this carefully) the subtract instruction SUB 4000, 2080, 2000.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Operation output, input1, input2</code> gives us [48<em>2,9</em>0,14*14] on multiply and [2-48,0-9,14-14] on subtract.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Much Faster.</strong> In our walk through of the F/E Cycle the answer computed was 42, whicha ccording to Douglas Adam’s <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> is “The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.” Adams reveals in the book that the mythical Deep Thought computer took 7.5 million years to get the answer; the computer in your phone executes five steps above in about 7.5 nanoseconds. If there are a billion nanoseconds in a second and 31 million seconds in a year, how many times faster is your phone at computing 42 than Deep Thought?
    <ul>
      <li>The equation is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7.5 * 10**6 years / 7.5 nanoseconds</code> giving us <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10**6 * (3.1 * 10**7)sec/year * 10**9</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.1 * 10**22</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>OR Circuitry.</strong> Processors also have an instruction OR, ANS, A, B, which is true if either of A or B is true (or both); it’s false only if both are false. Using split wire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-[___]-</code> show where MOS transistors should be positioned to compute this instruction, assuming the gate conducts when the operand value is 1.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 - top/bottom - (1 if top and bottom is 1)</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Consider sending a file of 1200K bytes from Host A to Host B over a circuit-switched network. Suppose it takes 100 ms to establish an end-to-end circuit between Host A and Host B before Host A can begin to transmit the file. Also suppose the end-to-end circuit pass through four cross-connect switches and traverse five optical fiber links with lengths 450 km, 450 km, 800 km, 1200 km, and 500 km respectively. On each link the circuit has a transmission rate of 640 Kbit/s. How much time does it minimum take to send the file from Host A to Host B? (Assume a speed of light in fiber of 200 000 000 m/s)
```
# Circuit switched
A->B: 1200K Bytes
100ms to establish
Crosses through:
- 4 cross-connect switches
- 5 optical fiber (450km, 450km, 800km, 1200km, 500km)
Transmission rate: 640Kbit/s
Speed of light in fiber: 200*1E6m/s
d_est = 0.1s (trenger ikke å gange med 5 pga circuit switched)
d_prop = (450+450+800+1200+500)*1E3/(200*1E6) = 0.017s
d_trans = (1200*8*1E3)/(640*1E3) = 15s (trenger ikke å gange med 5 pga circuit switched)
d_end = d_est + d_prop + d_trans = 15.117s

# 2.2
 Consider sending a file of 1200K bytes from Host A to Host B over a connectionless packet switched network. Assume that the whole file is sent as one large packet, i.e. without any fragmentation. Suppose the end-to-end path passes through four store-and-forward routers, traversing five optical fiber links with lengths 450 km, 450 km, 800 km, 1200 km, and 500 km respectively, and each link has a transmission rate of 640 Kbit/s. What is the minimum time needed to send the file from Host A to Host B? (Assume a speed of light in fiber of 200 000 000 m/s).
```
# Packet switched
A->B: 1200K Bytes
# No fragmentation
Passes through:
- 4 store-and-forward routers
- 5 five optical fiber (450km, 450km, 800km, 1200km, 500km)
Transmission rate: 640 Kbit/s
Fiber speed: 200E6 m/s

d_prop = (450+450+800+1200+500)*1E3/(200*1E6) = 0.017s
d_trans = (5*1200*8*1E3)/(640*1E3) = 75s
d_end = d_prop + d_trans = 75.017s

# 2.3
Consider a broadcast channel with 10 nodes and transmission rate of 100 Mbit/s. The broadcast channel uses polling (with an additional polling node) for multiple access. The polling delay, which is the amount of time from when a node completes transmission until the subsequent node is permitted to transmit, is 1ms. Suppose that within a polling round, a given node is allowed to transmit at most 100K bits. What is the maximum throughput of the broadcast channel?
```
Broadcast channel with 10 nodes
Transmission rate: 100 Mbit/s
Polling (polling node) for Multiple Access
Polling delay: 1ms
At most 100K bits
Maximum throughput?
# Max bit on one polling: 10*100E3 = 1E6
# d_trans = 100E3/100E6 = 1ms
# d_polling = 1ms
# Time used per round: 10*(d_polling + d_proc) = 0.02s
d_end = d_polling + d_proc
Maximum throughput = 1E6/0.02 = 5Mbit/s
```

# 2.4
Consider two hosts that are connected by a channel. The channel has a transmission rate of 100 Mbit/s. The maximum packet size in the network is 10K bytes. Assume the stations are far apart so the propagation delay between the two hosts is 30 ms. Assume that acknowledgements can be is-sued immediately when the last bit of a packet has been received (i.e. processing delay is ignored) and that the ACK packets are so small that their transmission times can be ignored. What is the max-imum data rate that can be achieved by the stop-and-wait flow control protocol in this situation?
```
Transmission rate: 100Mbit/s
Max packet size: 10K
d_prop = 30ms
processing delay is ignored
transmission n time is ignored
# Max d_trans = L/R = 10E3/100E6 = 0.0008s
# Max part of total time used for trans (U_trans): (L/R)/(RTT +(L/R)) = 0.0008/(0.060 + 0.0008) = 0.01315789
RTT is d_prop*2
Maximum data rate = U_trans * R = 0.01315789 * 100E6 = 1.315789Mbit/s 
```

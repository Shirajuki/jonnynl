# Trender i MMI
### Ulike paradigmer/trender i MMI
- "Rocket mail": Mail delivered within hours by guided missiles. [E-mail]
- "Memex (memory extender)": A device which stores communication items and records which may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility [PC]
- "The Dynabook": Notebook like concept [Tablet]
### 3 Waves of HCI
- "Xerox Start (1981)": Første kommersielle datamaskin som inneholdt det vi idag betrakter som standard for en PC.
- fagfeltet HCI / tidlig MMI
  - Computer science
  - Cognitive science (psykologi?)
  - Human factors engineering
#### 1
- (1980s-1990s): Research with goal to optimize brukervennlighet for  human and computer.
- Model driven: Tommelfinger regler, enkel rigid guidelines.
- Model Human Processor (MHP)
  - Calculation of how long a single user will take to carry ot a task.
  - Perceptual system - Displays 
  - Motor system - Controls
  - Cognitive system - Machine stat / idle + tenkning
- Modellere menneskelig måte å tenke på for en mskin. => The information processing loop.
- Forenklet måte å tenke på. => The desktop metaphor.
#### 2
- (1990s-early 2000s): "Post-cognitivist HCI", turn to the social.
- Grupper som jobber sammen i ulike applikasjoner. Trekke inn bruker for å få dem til å selv utvikle brukergrensesnittet.
- Participatory design workshops
- Prototyping
- Contextual inquiries
- ISO 13407:1999 Human-centred desgin processes for interactive systems.
#### 3
- (mid 2000s-present): Technology blir til everyday. From designer-intended purpose to user-projected meaning.
- User eXperience (UX) - (emotions self-expression, self-reflection, aesthetics)
- Value-sensitive design. Behaviour change technology. Exploratory research. Cultural probes.
#### FUTURE
- From Human-computer interaction to Human-comptuer integration. Tool to partner. Instructions/commands to negotations.
- Embodied partnerships, technology integrated with the body.

#### Summary + concluding remarks
- HCI moved from the focus on making usable tools for single users in work environments (1st wave HCI)
- To multiple and complex aspects of interaction (2nd & 3rd wave HCI)
  - Various devices
  - Dynamic use contexts
  - Group interactions
  - Everyday lives use
  - UX values
- Tool-notion to tool-thinking and integration => partnership.
